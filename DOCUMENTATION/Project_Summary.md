## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Core Language** | Java | 21 | Main application development |
| **UI Framework** | JavaFX | 22 | Desktop user interface |
| **Build Tool** | Maven | 3.6+ | Dependency management and build |
| **Styling** | CSS | 3 | Modern theme and responsive design |
| **Version Control** | Git | Latest | Source code management |

### System Architecture

The application follows a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
File Mana Application
├── MainApp.java (Application Entry Point)
├── EditorController.java (Main Controller - MVC Pattern)
├── Components/
│   ├── TextEditor.java (Full-featured text editor)
│   ├── SidePanel.java (Sidebar with controls)
│   └── FileNavigator.java (VSCode-like file tree)
├── Services/
│   └── FileService.java (File operations and auto-save)
└── Resources/
    ├── CSS Themes (Modern dark theme)
    └── Application Icons (File Mana branding)
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Clear separation of data, presentation, and logic
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven communication between components
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Centralized file operations and business logic
- **Component Pattern**: Reusable, modular UI components
- **Asynchronous Pattern**: Non-blocking operations for better performance

## IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### File Management System

**Smart Naming Convention:**
- Input: "Ahmed" → Output: `Ahmed-org.txt`, `Ahmed-rev.txt`, `Ahmed-byte.txt`
- Automatic folder creation: `Created files/Ahmed/`
- Duplicate handling with unique suffixes
- Extension sanitization (removes .txt if accidentally added)

**File Operations:**
- Asynchronous file I/O for performance
- UTF-8 encoding for international character support
- Atomic operations to prevent data corruption
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Content Processing Algorithms

**String Reversal:**
```java
// Efficient O(n) reversal algorithm
String reversedContent = new StringBuilder(content).reverse().toString();
```

**Byte Conversion:**
```java
// UTF-8 byte conversion with space separation
byte[] bytes = content.getBytes("UTF-8");
String byteString = Arrays.stream(bytes)
    .mapToObj(b -> String.valueOf(b & 0xFF))
    .collect(Collectors.joining(" "));
```

**Word Replacement:**
```java
// Position-based word replacement with validation
String[] words = content.split("\\s+");
if (position > 0 && position <= words.length) {
    words[position - 1] = replacement;
    return String.join(" ", words);
}
```

### User Interface Excellence

**Modern Design Features:**
- Dark theme with #181A20 background color
- Professional color scheme with high contrast
- Responsive layout adapting to screen sizes
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Accessibility-compliant design

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Intuitive workflow with minimal learning curve
- Real-time feedback for all operations
- Context-sensitive help and tooltips
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Visual indicators for unsaved changes
