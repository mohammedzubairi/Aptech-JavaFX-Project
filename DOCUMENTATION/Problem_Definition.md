# PROBLEM DEFINITION

---

## PROJECT TITLE: FILE MANA - MODERN TEXT EDITOR

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write a program in Java which should create a file and data in it. Once the data added in the file, other file must be created which should display the reverse of the data present in it. Next it must compare the data of both file and must check whether the content are same or not. The data of the first file must be display on the App screen and then it must extract the word and replace it with other. The position and data to be altered must be asked by the user. Once the data is replaced the content of the file must be changed and last the data of the first file must be converted in to byte codes.

## 2. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Core Functional Requirements

**FR1: File Creation and Data Management**
- Create files programmatically using Java I/O operations
- Add and manage textual data within created files
- Implement proper file handling with error management
- Support multiple file formats and naming conventions

**FR2: Content Reversal and Comparison**

- Create secondary file containing reversed content
- Implement content comparison algorithms
- Validate data integrity between original and reversed files

**FR3: User Interface and Display**
- Display file content on application screen
- Provide intuitive user interface for file operations
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Support modern UI/UX principles with dark theme

**FR4: Text Processing and Word Replacement**
- Extract words from text based on user-specified positions
- Implement word replacement functionality
- Allow user input for position and replacement data
- Update file content after word replacement operations

**FR5: Byte Code Conversion**
- Convert text data to byte representation
- Save byte codes in separate file
- Maintain data integrity during conversion
- Support different encoding formats

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Performance**

- Support files up to 10MB in size
- Efficient memory usage for large text processing

**NFR2: Usability**
- Intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Auto-save functionality to prevent data loss
- Clear error messages and user feedback

**NFR3: Reliability**
- Robust error handling for file operations
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Graceful handling of system failures
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

**NFR4: Maintainability**
- Modular code architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation and comments
- Extensible design for future enhancements
- Following Java coding standards and best practices

## 3. EXPECTED OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS

### 3.1 Primary Outputs

**Output 1: File Creation**
- Files created with smart naming convention
- Three file variants: original (-org.txt), reversed (-rev.txt), byte codes (-byte.txt)
- Organized folder structure for file management

**Output 2: Content Display**
- Original file content displayed on application screen
- Real-time content updates and synchronization
- Syntax highlighting and formatting options

**Output 3: User Interaction**
- Input dialogs for word position specification
- Text replacement interface with confirmation
- Status updates and operation feedback

**Output 4: File Processing**
- Reversed content generation and file creation
- Word extraction and replacement functionality
- Byte code conversion and storage

**Output 5: Data Validation**
- Content comparison between original and processed files
- Integrity checks and validation reports
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 3.2 Technical Specifications

**File Naming Convention:**
- Input: "Ahmed" → Output: Ahmed-org.txt, Ahmed-rev.txt, Ahmed-byte.txt
- Automatic extension handling and duplicate prevention
- Folder-based organization for file sets

**User Interface Requirements:**
- Modern JavaFX application with responsive design
- 70% editor area, 30% sidebar layout
- VSCode-inspired file navigator with context menus
- Dark theme with professional styling

**Processing Algorithms:**
- String reversal using StringBuilder.reverse()
- Byte conversion using UTF-8 encoding
- Word extraction using regex patterns and indexing
- File I/O using BufferedReader/BufferedWriter
